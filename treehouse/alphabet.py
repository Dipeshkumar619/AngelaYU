## Challenge ##
# Write code to find the word in a
# list that would come first alphabetically

## Example: When given the list below
# word_list = ["hamster", "turtle", "cat", "bird"]
# The code should find "bird" as the word that
# would come first alphabetically
# word_list = ["hamster", "turtle", "cat", "bird"]
def sort_alphabetically(word_list):
    word_list.sort()
    return word_list
# class Treehouse():
#     def __init__(self,name):
#         self.product="coding courses"
#         self.name = name

#     def learn(self):
#         # return "{} is learning to code!".format(self.name)
#         return f"{self.name} is learning to code!"
# my_treehouse=Treehouse("Dipesh")
# print(my_treehouse.learn())
